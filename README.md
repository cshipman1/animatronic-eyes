# Animatronic Dinosaur Eye System (Planning)

## Overview
This project is an in-progress animatronic eye mechanism designed to simulate realistic dinosaur eye movements for themed entertainment applications. The system will combine Arduino-based servo control with a Raspberry Pi running OpenCV for face tracking and coordinated movement.

## Features (Planned & In Progress)
- Pan/tilt gaze using dual servos
- Synchronized blinking mechanism
- OpenCV-based face tracking for interactive behavior
- Arduino motion control with smooth movement profiles

## Technologies
- Arduino (servo motion control, embedded programming)
- Raspberry Pi (OpenCV, image processing)
- C++ / Python

## Status
- Currently in planning & prototyping stage.
